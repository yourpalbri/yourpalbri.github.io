			<h4>
				<p><span class="emphasis">August 2014 - </span>I came to Carnegie Mellon University craving to learn how to engage with all people, despite our incalculable differences in experience.  Having had many leadership opportunities throughout high school, I was obsessed with trying to maximize my ability to effectively communicate with and understand others. I saw a major in Psychology as a necessary self-enriching experience to prepare me for whatever path I later pursued, as no important life goal seemed to exist outside the influence of possessing an ability to empathize with people of all shapes and sizes.</p>
				<p><span class="emphasis">December 2016 - </span> An influential and compassionate mentor in my research lab approached me one day about considering an honors thesis.  I realized I had no passion for this potential project, and I was terrified.  Deciding to venture out in pursuit of my next goal, I registered for more creative writing classes and downloaded the Adobe Suite, writing and design being two areas I have always admired from afar.
				</p>
				<p>Not even a year since I started this journey, I have a portfolio of work I could not be more proud of and a vivid image of how I can best make a positive impact on other people during this stage of my life.</p>
